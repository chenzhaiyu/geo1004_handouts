@article{Blum67,
	Annote = {Blum takes a new approach to shape. It is problematic to capture shape in a usefull mathematical way, certainly when you try to describe it by analyzing the boundary of the shape itself. On the other hand he notes that people are able to easily recognize and distinguish known shapes, even when strongly distorted in e.g. a cartoon (sometimes even used to enhance recognition).
He then goes on and defines the properties of
"
1) excitation - each point can have a value of either 0 or 1
2) propagation - each excited point excites and adjacent point with a delay prportional to the distance
3) refraction - once fired, an excited point is not affected by a second firing for some aribitrary interval of time
"
these are defined on each point of the continious isotrpoic plane, on which the contour (boundary) of a shape is impinged, exicting the plane at those point. The spreading of the excitation is now key to the definition of the Medial Axis Function (MAF), which is defined at those points where the wave fronts of excited points meet (a corner). Also included in the MAF are the times at which the corners appear. Visualize as a grass fire.

Then Blum gives two alternative definitions , most natably: "the MA is the locus of points equidistant from the pattern and in this sense represents a line of symmetry of the pattern". Some properties of the MAF:
Non-convex shapes will have parts of the MAF outside the shape itself.
The MAF represents exactly the same information as the contour/shape itself.
The connectedness of the MAF is to some degree stable for deformation in the input contour.

He then goes in describing some limitations and more properties/applications.

Part of the paper is not so easy to read due to the use words and terms that I'm unfamiliar with.},

@inproceedings{Brisson89,
	Abstract = {We develop a representation for the topological structure of subdivided manifolds (with and without boundary) of dimension d ≥ 1 which allows straightforward access of the available order information. It is shown that there exists a large amount of ordering information in subdivided manifolds: given a (k-2)-cell in the boundary of a (k+1)-cell, 1≤ k ≤ d, all of the k- and (k-1)-cells `between them' can be ordered `around' the (k-2)-cell. This includes the usual orderings in 2- and 3-dimensional objects. We introduce the `cell-tuple structure', a simple, uniform representation of the incidence and ordering information in a subdivided manifold. It includes the quad-edge data structure of Guibas and Stolfi [GS 85] and the facet-edge data structure of Dobkin and Laszlo [DL 87] as special cases in dimensions 2 and 3, respectively.},

- The cell-tuple structure
- In the switch operator, any n-dimensional cell can be obtained by 3 incident cells of n-1, n and n+1 dimensions (lemma 1)
- Switch_k applies switch as switch(k-1, k, k+1)
- The cell-tuple is conformed of: (1) a cell description based on the 3 incidencies, and (2), a tuple made of switch_k  for 0 <= k <= d
- The cell-tuple structure is then the set of all the cell-tuples
- Given a k-2-cell and a k+1-cell, k-1-cells and k-cells between them can be ordered around the k-2-cell, alternating between k-1-cells and k-cells

	Abstract = {When approximately 15 years ago we became interested in the computational geometry of polyhedra, we soon realized that certain basic notions (e.g. face of a polyhedron) were not properly defined, and that no appropriate theory was available. Most things therefore had to be done on a purely intuitive basis, leading into difficulties especially in certain singular cases (cf. [09]). Nevertheless a large number of publications in the field have since appeared, e.g. [08], [10], [13] to [18] and [21] to mention only some of the most significant.
Major problems have been caused by the fact that the family of polyhedra is not closed with respect to certain elementary operations. This situation can be got under control in two different ways:
- "regularization" of the operations ([21],[25]), or
- adaption of the definition of polyhedra.
Following the second way we established a system of definitions and theorems destined to serve as a basis for the whole field ([19]). The theory having proved to be appropriate for several applications (of. [04],[05],[06]) we now present new algorithms (those in [19] being too complicated from today's standpoint) for the elementary algebraic and topological operations on polyhedra in Rd, namely complement, intersection, union, difference, closure and interior. By their combination regularized operations too are realizable.},
	Annote = {Using a n-d polyhedron definition based on half-spaces:
- An apex is a point in which we can pass a half-space and all of the set (conr) is on one side of it.
- A pyramid is a cone and a polyhedron
- A polyhedron is described by a set of pyramids adjoined to it

The implementation can be based on structures that represent the local pyramids.},

@article{Blandford05,
	Abstract = {We describe data structures for representing simplicial meshes compactly while supporting online queries and updates efficiently. Out representation required about a factor of four or five less memory than the most efficient standard representations of triangular or tetrahedral meshes, while efficiently supporting traversal among simplices, storing data on simplices, and insertion and deletion of simplices.
We have used the representation in 2D and 3D incremental algorithms for Delaunay triangulation/tetrahedralization. The 3D algorithm can generate 100 Million tetrahedrons with 1.1 Gbytes of memory, including the space for the coordinates and all data used by the algorithm. The runtime of the algorithm is as fast as Shewchuk's pyramid code, the most efficient we know of, and uses a factor of 3 less memory.},
	Annote = {Nice paper. Great references to other algorithms.

- The memory usage of mesh representations limits their applications. Some options to solve it: external memory algorithms, compressing meshes, or simply be more efficient.
- They manage 100m triangles in 1 GB of memory and 100m tetrahedra in 1.1 GB
- Mesh representations for 2D: triangle based (e.g. Shewchuk) 6+ pointers/triangle, edge based (e.g. DCEL, winged-edge, half-edge and quad-edge) 4+ pointers/edge
- Mesh representations for 3D: tetrahedron based (e.g. Pyramid and CGAL) 8+ pointers/tetrahedron, boundary representations (e.g. facet-edge, radial edge, cell-tuple and g-maps) 6+ pointers/edge-face.

How it works:
- Stores a simplex as an ordered cycle of the labels of its vertices
- Stores some edges only, those whose end vertices have both even or both odd labels.
- Use difference coding to represent the vertices and a variable-length prefix code
- Relabels vertices using a divide-and-conquer alternating cuts algorithm
- Interesting implementation with Shewchuk predicates, single precision fp},

	Abstract = {In order to handle spatial data efficiently, as required in computer aided degisn and geo-data applications, a database system needs an index mechanism that will help it ￼￼￼￼￼￼retrieve data items quickly according to their spatial locations. However, traditional indexing methods are not well suited to data oblects of non-zero size located in multidimensional spaces. In this paper we describe a dynamic index structure called an R-tree which meets this need, and give algorithms for searching and updating it. We present the results of a series of tests which indicate that the structure performs well, and conclude that it is useful for current database systems in spatial applications.},
	Annote = {The original paper that describes R-trees. It covers: 
- Description of the data structure
- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Updates and other operations
- Node splitting using different algorithms

Plus some tests covering the different splitting algorithms},

	Abstract = {A wide range of environmental process simulations would benefit from the development of GIS able to cope with the additional dimensions of vertical space and time, and having extended spatial modelling facilities. The results of a project in the first of these areas, namely on the development of techniques for handling four-dimensional (4-D) data, are described. The key topics of data models, visualization and interpolation have been studied. Problems include the large size of some 4-D data sets, the sparseness of sampling in some dimensions compared with others, and the need to combine data sets from different sensors which may be of different dimensionalities and scales. The gridded volume data common to most environmental models are stored in a 4-D bintree form in which all dimensions are treated identically. Simple 4-D objects may also be stored, and links are provided between volume and object databases. The techniques have been implemented within a computational testbed allowing parallel processing to cope with large data sizes.},

Incremental algo to build a Delaunay triangulation both in 2d and 3d. Very complete article with data structure, algorithm descriptions, but the maths is not so simple. REGULAR TRIANGULATION: A finite point set in R^d defines a unique Delaunay triangulation, but there are many regular triangulations of the set. A unique regular triangulation is implied if each point is assigned a real number a sits weight. If all weights are the same, then the regular triangulation is the Delaunay triangulation of the set They are using a simple tetrahedron-based data structure... like the one used by Shewchuk and in CGAL. The paper unifies 3 methods to build a DT in 3d: - Joe91 cause he stated that a DT can be kept up-to-date by a sequence of local flips after the insertion of a new point; - Rajan91 because of his priority queue to determine the order in which the flips must be done; - Guibas85for his point-location (Walk()) function in 2d. They remplace the priority queue by a stack and they use the incremental; EXACTLY what i am doing right now. Like in my program, when a flip is not possible they do not do anything. The point-location is not really important for me at the moment; and it seems messy to implement. There are no mentions of the different configurations possible between 2 adjacent tetra; only that Swap23 \& Swap32 must be done. And no mentions of nasty cases with coplanar and cospherical pts. They work with a 'big tetra', an aritificial infinite tetra enclosing all points. Therefore every point is added inside the triangulation. "Several algo proposed for DT are based on the notion of a local transformation, henceforth referred to as a flip. Historically, the 1st such algorithm is due to Lawson77. Given a finite point set in the real plane, in 2d, the algo first constructs an arbitrary triangulation of the set. This triangulation is then gradually altered through a sequence of edge-flips until the DT is obtained. the genz of this method to 3d has difficulties, and Joe91 demonstrates that it's indeed incorrect if the flips are applied to an arbitrary initial triangulation." This is because in 2d a flip (always Swap22) is always possible; but in 3d it is not... (p. 235) An analysis of the proposed algo. The expected running time in 3d is O(nlogn + n3/2); while the running time is O(n2), which is worst-case optimal. The maximum number of flips possible is described, and is O(n2), which is also the worst-case storage.},

	Annote = {The extension in 3d of Lawson77's method to transform an arbitrary triangulation into a DT with a sequence of flips doesn't work. This is showed in Joe89: sometimes a tetra is not Delaunay but cannot be flipped; so it is impossible to have a DT. Joe91 introduces a method called 'incremental flip' to construct a DT; always starting from a DT; adding each point one at a time and updating each time the triangulation. "Local transformations can be used to construct a Delaunay triangulation." Good definition of Delaunay in 3d: "Given n 3d points, the 3d Delaunay triangulation problem is to connect them into non-overlapping tetrahedra which fill the convex hull of the points such that the sphere criterion is satisfied, i.e., the circumsphere of the 4 vertices of any tetrahedron of the triangulation contains none of the given n points in its interior". Good explanation of the possible configurations for the 2 tetra; and the algo described is almost the same one as the one i've implemented. "Note that the circumsphere of a-b-c-d contains e in its interior if and only if the circumsphere of a-b-c-e contains d in its interior. This follows from the fact that the intersection (a circle in 3d) of the circumspheres of a-b-c-d and a-b-c-e is the circumcircle of triangle a-b-c." "If the 3rd tetra in case ? is not present in T, then abc in non-transformable; i.e., the local transformation procedure cannot be applied". So in this case, just pop the next one from the stack. (p. 129) There's the definition of a Swap22; but i don't think he is doing this in his program. Doing this will destroy the topology of the mesh. The Swap44 is also showed. (p. 134). The improved algo puts only the interior faces on the stack. This is like my algo where i put tetra (instead of faces) on the stack and then check only for the opposite face from the newly inserted point. "From lemma 1 and 5, if all the interior faces in F are locally optimal, then all the interior faces in G (adjacent tetra) are also locally optimal". (p. 141) "It was shown in Joe89 that the Delaunay triangulation and the triangulation satisfying the max-min solid angle criterion are in general different in 3d (although they are the same in 2d)."},

- The world must be abstracted, generalized or approximated in the process of creating a database
- The relationship between reality and a database is complicated by the interposition of a map or analog storage with its own data model. This doesn't happen in 3D.
- Data modelling in the field based model can be seen as reducing the number of tuples required to a finite set small enough to fit in a certain amount of digital storage.
- Two strategies to discretise spatial variation: sampling involves a limited amount of points and the fact that one needs to be at a sufficient distance from a point for its value to have changed significantly, piecewise involves creating a planar partition of homogeneous regions, which might be interpolated between different values.
- Transportation networks are 1D addressing systems embedded in 2D space. (nodes and edges, no areas)
- Argues that the raster vs vector distinction is not sound for data modelling. Don't think so{\ldots}
- There was (at that time) a lack of suitable data for 3D GIS.},

However, he needs a priority queue to find the appropriate flips---sorting is done by power of the point to insert wrt the simplices (or lifted: intersection of hyperplanes with vertical edge passing through vertex p). In particular, we show that (a) the maximum min-containment radius (the radius of the smallest sphere containing the simplex) of the Delaunay triangulation of a point set in R^d is less than the maximum min-containment radius of any other triangulation of the point set, (b) if a valid triangulation consists of only self-centered triangles (a simplex whose circumcenter falls inside the simplex) then it is the Delaunay triangulation, and (c) there exists an incremental flip algorithm (one that modifies the triangulation locally to make it Delaunay) that can generate the Delaunay triangulation for any point set. We further show that the Delaunay triangulation can be seen as the optimum solution to a continuum optimization problem. The results of this paper suggest that the Delaunay triangulation is the most compact one in the sense that of having the smallest maximum min-containment spheres.},

The designer of a boundary modeler is therefore faced with the need of providing a sufficient collection of more convenient and efficient solid description facilities. On the other hand, they must take the integrity problems of boundary models discussed in the previous section into account, and seek for solid description techniques that either guarantee the integrity criteria, or (at least) make it difficult to construct invalid models" (p. 265) """ In particular, they should be 2-manifold, i.e., satisfy the following criteria: 1. Every edge belongs to exactly two flat faces. 2. Every vertex is surrounded by a single cycle of edges and faces. 3. Faces may not intersect each other except at common edges or vertices. """ (p.55) """ [...] we may view solid objects as point sets of the Euclidean three-dimensional space satisfying restrictions that catch our idea of "solidity". To such sets, solid modeling aims to assign finite representations suitable for generating data for algorithms. [...] Therefore, we need a representation that encodes the infinite point set in a finite amount of computer storage in a more generic fashion. Representations achieving this may be divided in three large classes as follows: 1. decomposition models 2. construtive models 3. boundary models """ (p.101) """Decomposition models and constructive models both view solids as point sets, and seek representations for the point set either dy discretizing it or by constructing it from a simpler point sets. In contrast to these models, boundary models represent a solid indirectly throught a representation of its bounding surface."""},
